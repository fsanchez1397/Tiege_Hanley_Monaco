Karen, MD, “Men may not be deliberately tanning as much, but if they go fishing or go out for a run, they tend not to lather up with sunscreen. In general, they're a little lazier than women are about taking proactive measures to protect themselves from sun damage.” Dr. Karen specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer at Complete Skin MD in NYC and is a clinical assistant professor in the Ronald O.
